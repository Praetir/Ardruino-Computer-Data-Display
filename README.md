# Ardruino-Computer-Data-Display
Project that takes inspiration from the outdated and non-functioning Arduino CPU Monitor project that can be found at https://www.hackster.io/zakrzu/arduino-pc-monitor-66c07a.

The ino file for the Arduino is included. For this particular setup an OLED 128x128 module is used. The library used with my screen is used with various modules.

There are still updates and features to come.
